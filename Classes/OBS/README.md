# OBS - Student Information System
This aim of the project is calculation of GPA.
In this project we have 3 different classes: Lecture, Tutor, Student.
In our case, we chose three different lessons, and we applied this example for only one student.
In Lecture class, we kept the lecture name, the tutor, and 2 different grades(verbal note, exam note) and their percentage.
In Tutor class, we kept the tutor name, its code, and its branch.
In Student class, we kept the student name, taken three different lectures, the grades(exam grades, verbal grades, final grades) for each course, and the average for calculation of GPA,
and finally passed or failed information that depends on the GPA.
